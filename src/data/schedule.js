Rhythm can put a swagger in your step or lull you to sleep, and it’s no wonder: rhythmical patterns infuse our everyday life. Walking, dancing, swaying, and skipping all have their own kinds of motion, each of which evokes a distinct feeling. The in and out of breathing and the thump of a heartbeat define our lives: rhythm is embedded in our very nature.",

Tragic as her early death was, her music remains powerfully alive. These two trios are fresh with new energy, while possessing a sense of perspective usually associated with “late” works. Her music stands alongside masterpieces by Debussy and Fauré in ambition, evocativeness, and originality.",
            "Both D’un matin de printemps and D’un soir triste are built around the same few notes, but like a painter capturing the same scene in different lights, Boulanger uses colorful harmonies to capture two gripping, but entirely different emotional moments."
