            "Birdfoot and the Jasper String Quartet delve into the life-giving energy of rhythm. Rhythm can put a swagger in your step or lull you to sleep, and it’s no wonder: rhythmical patterns infuse our everyday life. Walking, dancing, swaying, and skipping all have their own kinds of motion, each of which evokes a distinct feeling. The in and out of breathing and the thump of a heartbeat define our lives: rhythm is embedded in our very nature.",
            "Our physical experience of rhythm even connects to the way we hear and feel music. Join Birdfoot and the Jasper String Quartet Backstage to explore the vital role rhythm plays in communicating both feeling and narrative through music by Antonin Dvořák and Florence Price."

            "Celebrating its fifteenth anniversary in 2021, the Jasper String Quartet is recognized as one of the leading American string quartets on the performance stage today.",
            "A recipient of Chamber Music America’s prestigious Cleveland Quartet Award, the quartet has been hailed as “sonically delightful and expressively compelling” (The Strad) and their latest recording of music by Aaron Jay Kernis and Claude Debussy was described by Gramophone as “flawless in ensemble and intonation, expressively assured and beautifully balanced.” The New York Times named their album Unbound as one of the 25 Best Classical Recordings of 2017.",
            "Based in Philadelphia, the Jasper String Quartet is the Professional Quartet-in-Residence at Temple University’s Center for Gifted Young Musicians and Featured Artist-in-Residence at Swarthmore College for the 2020–22 academic years. In addition, the Quartet is the Founder and Artistic Director of Jasper Chamber Concerts."

            "In drip music*, composer Katherine Balch writes that: “From delicate, nearly inaudible drizzles of sound, splashes (heavy droplets) take over and begin to dance. This piece is about drawing attention to and then amplifying very tiny sounds, and is a celebratory exploration of the intimacies and intricacies of the string quartet."

            "The Argus Quartet is dedicated to encouraging the joys of human connection, community, and discovery by bringing a wide-ranging repertoire to life through bold and meaningful programming and a vibrant commitment to collaboration and education, winning recognition as a “vivacious foursome … [that] plays canonical standards with authority and verve and approaches modern music with care and assurance” (The New Yorker). Praised for playing with “supreme melodic control and total authority” and “decided dramatic impact” (Calgary Herald), the Quartet has quickly emerged as one of today’s most dynamic and versatile ensembles, winning First Prize at both the 2017 M-Prize Chamber Arts Competition and the 2017 Concert Artists Guild Victor Elmaleh Competition.",
            "Since then, increasingly busy concert seasons have taken the Quartet to some of the country’s most prestigious venues and festivals, including Carnegie’s Weill and Zankel Halls, Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall, Chamber Music Society of Detroit, the Ravinia Festival, the Albany Symphony’s American Music Festival, and Music Academy of the West. Highlights of the 2019-20 season included a debut performance for Lincoln Center’s Great Performers series, along with a return engagement in New York for the Schneider Concerts at the New School.",
            "The group has worked with many of today’s leading musical voices, including Martin Bresnick, Chris Cerrone, Ted Hearne, Garth Knox, Andrew Norman, Christopher Theofanidis, and Augusta Read Thomas. Recent commissions include new quartets by Katherine Balch, Donald Crockett, Eric Guinivan, Thomas Kotcheff, and Juri Seo. A recording of Seo’s works for string quartet was released in May 2019 on Innova Recordings. The Quartet has received grants from the Koussevitsky Foundation, Chamber Music America, and the Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts in support of their commissioning efforts.",
            "Education and outreach are an important part of the Argus Quartet’s mission. The Quartet has worked with students through residencies and masterclasses at Yale and Princeton, James Madison University, Rockport Music, the Milken School, the Young Musicians Foundation, California State University (at Long Beach and Northridge), and Los Angeles City College.",
            "Based in New York City, the Quartet was founded in Los Angeles in 2013, where its members shared many meals at their favorite taco truck on Argus Drive."
